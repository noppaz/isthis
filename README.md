Spotify's _This Is_ playlists are nice to choose some highlights from an artist but don't exist for all. This script allows for creation of _Is This_ playlists on Spotify with the artist's most popular songs when there isn't an official one.

The number of songs are configurable and the one's that are chosen are the most popular ones.
